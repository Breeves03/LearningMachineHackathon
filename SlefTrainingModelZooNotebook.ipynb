    "## ðŸ“Š Self-Training Classifier Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "This section demonstrates how to implement and evaluate a **semi-supervised learning pipeline using Self-Training Classifier**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective:\n",
    "Leverage both **labeled (`train_df`) and unlabeled (`test_df`) data** to improve model performance, and quantify the improvement using **Macro-F1 Score uplift**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Process Overview:\n",
    "1. **Supervised Split**  \n",
    "   - Split the labeled data (`train_df`) into:\n",
    "     - **Supervised training set** (`X_supervised_train`, `y_supervised_train`).\n",
    "     - **Validation set** (`X_val`, `y_val`).\n",
    "   - Validation set remains **untouched throughout training** and is used only for final evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Self-Training Setup**  \n",
    "   - Assign a placeholder label `-1` to the unlabeled data (`test_df`).\n",
    "   - **Combine supervised data and unlabeled data** into a new dataset for self-training.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Model Training**  \n",
    "   - Define a base classifier (e.g., RandomForest, LogisticRegression, CatBoost).\n",
    "   - Automatically wrap models needing scaling in a pipeline with `StandardScaler`.\n",
    "   - Apply `SelfTrainingClassifier` using the base model.\n",
    "   - Train the model, which will:\n",
    "     - Iteratively label the most confident unlabeled samples.\n",
    "     - Re-train on the expanded dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Evaluation & Uplift Calculation**  \n",
    "   - Predict on the **unseen validation set** (`X_val`).\n",
    "   - Calculate **Macro-F1 Score**:\n",
    "     - **Macro-F1** gives equal weight to each class, which is crucial for imbalanced datasets.\n",
    "   - Calculate the **uplift (%) over the supervised baseline**:\n",
    "     \\[\n",
    "     \\text{Uplift} = \\frac{F1_{self\\_training} - F1_{supervised}}{F1_{supervised}} \\times 100\n",
    "     \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Macro-F1 Score?\n",
    "- **Macro-F1** averages F1 scores per class, treating all classes equally.\n",
    "- Essential when **class imbalance exists**, ensuring performance isn't dominated by majority classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Metric:\n",
    "| Metric    | Description                                    |\n",
    "|-----------|------------------------------------------------|\n",
    "| Macro-F1  | Balanced F1 across all classes (unbiased by class size). |\n",
    "| Uplift %  | Percentage improvement of self-training vs supervised-only model. |\n",
